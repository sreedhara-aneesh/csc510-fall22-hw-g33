|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member "SASWAT123" is often 1.5 times more productive than the others... but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/SASWAT123/SoftwareEngineering/graphs/contributors)|
|Number of commits|3|[Total 124 commit history](https://github.com/SASWAT123/SoftwareEngineering/graphs/commit-activity)|

|DOI badge: exists|3|Exists in [README.md](https://github.com/SASWAT123/SoftwareEngineering/blob/master/README.md)|
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |3|[Wiki docs](https://github.com/SASWAT123/SoftwareEngineering/wiki)|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |0|Not available in docs|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|2|[Available in docs but limited](https://github.com/SASWAT123/SoftwareEngineering/wiki/Homework-3)|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|0|Not available in docs|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|Not available in docs|

|Chat channel: exists|0|NA|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|2|Code coverage on testing is limited|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3|100% code in python|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|2|[Wiki](https://github.com/SASWAT123/SoftwareEngineering/wiki/Homework-4) explains config|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|0|From [Wiki](https://github.com/SASWAT123/SoftwareEngineering/wiki/Homework-4)|
