|Commit-wise, workload is unevenly spread, but line-wise, not so much. It looks like the same work was done (roughly speaking), but some members opted to commit more than others.|2|[GitHub Insights](https://github.com/yagmurbbayraktar/CSC510_HW2_3_4_5/graphs/contributors)|

|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |0|Cannot find autogenerated documentation.|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |0|Cannot find autogenerated documentation.|
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|0|Cannot find documentation.|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|0|Cannot find documentation.|
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|0|Cannot find documentation.|

|Other automated analysis tools|3|[Github Actions](https://github.com/yagmurbbayraktar/CSC510_HW2_3_4_5/actions)|
|Test cases exist|3|[Tests](https://github.com/yagmurbbayraktar/CSC510_HW2_3_4_5/tree/main/test)|
|Test cases are routinely executed|3|[Github Actions](https://github.com/yagmurbbayraktar/CSC510_HW2_3_4_5/actions)|
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|2| [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/yagmurbbayraktar/CSC510_HW2_3_4_5/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md): exists but not very descriptive. |

|Chat channel: exists|0|Could not find one.|
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|3|Tests pass, no issues.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|3|Repository accessible by all.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|0|Does not include instructions on installation, no way to know what to do to be consistent.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|0|Does not include instructions on installation, no way to know what to do to be consistent.|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|2|Some individuals have way less commits than others, but similar line counts, suggesting that they worked on a few main subsections of the project rather than working across the codebase.|
|Short release cycles |1|[Release](https://github.com/yagmurbbayraktar/CSC510_HW2_3_4_5/releases/tag/v1.0): Only one release|
